# Hi, I'm Gabriel

I'm a software developer based in [Murcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murcia)
Currently I'm working doing stuff with JavaScript as a freelance. In my spare
time I like to learn React, [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and other cool technologies.
If you like to learn as I do, and you want to contribute to open source learning
resources I encourage you to have a look to [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/)
and [dwyl](http://www.dwyl.io/), the two best curiosity driven communities I have
ever seen.

I hope you are enjoying reading this blog, if you are interested on the things I'm
doing you can find my pet projects on [github/gabrielperales](https://github.com/gabrielperales).

If you want to contact me or you want to hire me, please don't forget to visit
the [hire me](/hire-me) section!.
